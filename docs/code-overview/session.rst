Session
=======

.. contents::

A Mathics3 Session consists of a Definitions object and an Evaluation object.

We describe these two components next.

A diagram of a single step in the Read/Eval/Print Loop (REPL) is shown in the diagram below:

Definitions
-----------

Front-ends like (django, mathicsscript, mathics, MathicsSession)
create a ``Definitions`` object which initially has definitions of the
thousand or so standard Mathics3 Builtins.  Front ends can customize
these definitions. Usually more variables are added under the
``Settings`` name space.  For example, for mathicsscript there is
a variable containing the syntax-highlighting style to use; it can be altered.
Also there is a list of all possible syntax styles styles which is not alterable and not
in the ``Settings`` namespace. For Django, there is a Boolean setting indicating whether or
not to use a Sans-Serif font.

session.evaluate() at a High Level
-------------------------------------

In order to process input requests, an ``Evaluation`` object needs to
be created using some set of definitions. (Right now a new evaluation
object is created for each top-level expression, but this might not be
needed, and the prior object might be reused.)

This session evaluation object has a scan-and-parse method which is passed some sort of
I/O handle to read from. The result of that is an M-expression
described in :ref:`AST <ast>`.

This M-expression result is then passed to the ``evaluate()`` method
of the evaluation object. ``evaluate()`` is an apply/eval process that is
typically found functional languages; the "apply" phase here covers
term-rewriting application and function-symbol application.

In the rewrite/apply/eval process, rules, symbols and function
definitions can get altered. A front end will want the changed
definitions to persist in a Mathics3 session while the Evaluation
object may or may not.

The direct or return result of rewrite/apply/eval is a Mathics
Expression for the input.

For example if the input expression was parsed to the M-expression
``Plus[1, 2]`` the output Expression would be ``3``. Recall that
numbers and symbols are expressions too.

This result type, Mathics3 Expression, differs from the input
M-Expression in that symbols found in the Expression may be bound and
various properties may be attached to the expression and its
subexpressions. For example we may tag that resulting expression with
a property that it is numeric such as in the example above where the
result Expression was 3.

In those cases where nothing can be filled in, the result may be an
M-Expression. And here it can often is *same* M-Expression that was
input.

Here is a simple example showing how to do evaluation from a
session in Python using ``session.evaluate()``::

  $ python
  Python 3.8.10 ..
  >>> from mathics.session import MathicsSession
  >>> session = MathicsSession()
  >>> graph_circle = session.evaluate("Graph3D[Circle[]]")
  >>> graph_circle
  <Expression: Global`Graph3D[System`Circle[System`List[0, 0]]]>

In the above example, the input ``Graph3D[Circle[]]`` is changed, but not that much:

* Namespaces are filled in from the abbreviated variables names. So we have
  ``Global`Graph3D`` instead of ``Graph3D`` and ``System`Circle`` instead of
  ``Circle``
* Rewrite rules have been applied. Here, it it is just to take the empty
  parameter list for ``Circle``, ``[]``, and expand that into a list,
  ``System`List[0, 0]``. Note that internally no nice abbreviations like ``{0, 0}``
  are used for the replaced output list. Expansion here has the effect of filling in
  the default value for a circle: a point whose center is at 0, 0.

We will come back to this example in the next section on formatting.

The pipeline sequence of operations: *tokenize input*, *parse tokens*,
and *evaluate* is common, and is done continuously inside a REPL. So there is a method
on the evaluation method called ``parse_evaluate()`` that does all 3
of these things.

The result from a top-level ``parse_evaluate()`` is a special ``Result`` kind of object containing:

*out*:
   a Python list containing all the messages and printed strings produced

*line_no*:
    the last line number for how far in the input progressed. This is most useful if there was an error.

*result*:
    a Python object containing the formatted version of the result of the evaluation

*last_eval*:
    the last result of the evaluation (an M-Expression), without formatting.

After reading in an expression, parsing it and
evaluating it, a front end will typically will want to show the results.

Expression.format()
-------------------

Here we describe the formatting process that produces ``result`` from
the Expression in ``last_eval``.

Expressions need to be wrapped in some sort of "Form", like
``TeXForm`` or ``MathMLForm``. This is done using the ``format()``
method of the expression object. This goes through the
rewrite/apply/eval process producing a Mathics3 Expression where
"Box"ing rules have been applied at various points in the expression;
boxing functions associated with expression objects, direct the boxing process.

Continuing using the example in the last section::

    >>> graph_circle
    <Expression: Global`Graph3D[System`Circle[System`List[0, 0]]]>
    >>>  graph_circle.format(session.evaluation, "TeXForm")
    <Expression: System`RowBox[System`List["\text{Graph3D}\left[\text{Circle}\left[\left\{0,0\right\}\right]\right]"]]>
    >>> graph_circle.format(session.evaluation, "MathMLForm")
    <Expression: System`RowBox[System`List["<math display="block"><mrow><mi>Graph3D</mi> <mo>[</mo> <mrow><mi>Circle</mi> <mo>[</mo> <mrow><mo>{</mo> <mrow><mn>0</mn> <mo>,</mo> <mn>0</mn></mrow> <mo>}</mo></mrow> <mo>]</mo></mrow> <mo>]</mo></mrow></math>"]]>
    >>>

Notice in the above that ``format()`` was passed
``session.evaluation``. This gives the formatting the ability not just
to query the environment outside of what was passed inside the
``graph_circle`` expression, but it also allows the fomartting to call
back Mathics3 to perform additional calculations. For example, it is
conceivable that a particular formatter might want to know on what
plain a particular polygon lies on, and Mathics3 might be able to get
the answer to that.

This box expression is at the end converted into a string by means of
the method ``boxes_to_text()`` on the form-boxed-formatted Expression, and is what
at the end will be processed and shown in the front end.
