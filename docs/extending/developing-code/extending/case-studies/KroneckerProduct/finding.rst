Finding a corresponding SymPy function and Wikipedia name for ``KroneckerProduct``
==================================================================================

Going to a `SymPy search page
<https://docs.sympy.org/latest/search.html>`_ and looking for
"Kronecker", we find this function and get a link to that.  We also
learn that it is also called a `"tensor product matrix"
<https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/physics/quantum/tensorproduct.html>`_.

Knowing alternate names can sometimes be helpful in finding the
corresponding Wikipedia entry. For example, the mathics function
""EulerPhi" function is called "totient" in SymPy, and the Wikipedia
name is "Euler's totient function".

The Wikipedia name for ``KroneckerProduct`` is "Kronecker product".
