Adding Builtin ``Undefined``
============================

``Undefined``, like ``$MachineName`` is one of the easier kinds of Builtin's to add because: it
is simply a Built-in Symbol, not a Function. Builtin Symbols are
pretty limited in what they do. Basically a built-in Symbol is a name in the ``System``
namespace with some properties.

Also, there are existing modules of Built-in Symbols that we can use as a model here.

Below are the steps in order that were used to create ``Undefined``:
