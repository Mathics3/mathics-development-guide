Documentation Markup
====================

There home-grown special markup syntax you can use in the
documentation. It is kind of a mixture of XML, LaTeX, Python doctest,
and custom markup.

*In the future, we plan to use more Sphinx-based documentation.*

The following commands can be used to markup documentation text:

+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+

To include images in the documentation, use the ``img`` tag, place an
EPS file *src* ``.eps`` in `mathics.doc.documentation.images <https://github.com/mathics/Mathics/tree/master/mathics/doc/documentation/images>`_ and run ``images.sh``
in the `mathics.doc <https://github.com/mathics/Mathics/tree/master/mathics/doc>`_ directory.

For a long *URL*, it is possible to split the url in several lines. Spaces and line break characters are removed when the documentation is compiled. For example::



     <url>:NetworkX:
     https://networkx.org/documentation/networkx-2.8.8/reference/algorithms/\
     generated/networkx.algorithms.tree.mst.minimum_spanning_edges.html
     </url>


produces, in the online documentation, the following ``<a>`` tag:

``<a href=https://networkx.org/documentation/networkx-2.8.8/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.tree.mst.minimum_spanning_edges.html>NetworkX</a>``


Markup for Code Examples
------------------------

.. _doc_test_markup:

.. index:: >>, #>, X>, S>, ..., \|, =

The following commands can be used to specify test cases.

+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Markup                 | Meaning                                                   |
+========================+===========================================================+
| ``>>`` *Mathics3 code* | Some Mathics3 code to run and to appear in documentation. |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| ``=`` *output*         | expected output produced by the Mathics3 code.            |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| ``...``                | matches any output; used when output can vary.            |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| ``.``                  | a newline which is expected to appear in test output.     |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| ``-Graphics-``         | graphics in the test result.                              |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| ``:`` *message*        | a message in the result of the test query.                |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| ``\|`` *print*         | a printed line in the result of the test query.           |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

It is good to create examples that convey some aspect about the Mathics3 Function.

In the past, the documentation system was abused and ran edge cases
and prior bugs fixed. For that please write a pytest.

However please don't create more examples. Instead please consider
moving something like this to a pytest unit test which is far more flexible.

Example of ``>>``, ``=``, and ``= ...``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block::

     >> 1 + 2
     = 3

The above is part of the docstring for the ``Plus`` class that implements the builtin-function ``Plus``, or operator ``+``.

``1 + 2`` is shown as an example in the ``Plus`` documentation
section.  When this code is run, ``3`` is the expected output.

In testing, ``make doctest`` is run, this example code is run and checked
against the output. If the two do not match, a test failure is
recorded.

In some cases, output can vary. For example, the value one gets when
evaluating ``$ProcessID`` is not fixed and can't be recorded. So
here, use ``...`` and *anything* will be accepted as a match:

.. code-block::

    >> $ProcessID
     = ...

The main goal of Doctests is to check illustrative cases that make sense to appear in
the documentation. However, in some cases, we want to include some code needed to 
clean up variables or delete files created in the example. Also, there are some test cases
that only work in a sandbox environment. On the other hand, we could desire to include 
some code in the *Doctest* format, but we do not want to run it during the tests. For this reason,
the following syntax was included:


+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Markup                 | Meaning                                                                     |
+========================+=============================================================================+
| ``#>`` *Mathics3 code* | Mathics3 code to run but not appearing documentation.                       |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``X>`` *Mathics3 code* | Mathics3 code shown in the documentation but not run.                       |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``S>``                 | Mathics3 code to run, like ``>>``, but only if not in "Sandbox" environment |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In any case, as far as possible, please avoid to include as doctests any marginal case that does not
contribute to the understanding of the final user. Very specific test cases must be included as tests
in the *pytest* system.

Example of ``#>``
+++++++++++++++++

.. code-block::

    Strings and expressions that produce strings are atoms:
    >> Map[AtomQ, {"x", "x" <> "y", StringReverse["live"]}]
     = {True, True, True}
    #> Clear[x]


Here, we want to give an example of ``Map`` and that sets variable ``x``. We want to
clear the definition to clean things up, but doing so does not serve any pedagogic purposes.
So we can hide this from the list of examples, but have the effect of running the function.


Examples of ``S>``
++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block::

    S> $MachineName
     = ...

In a cloud environment, we do not want to give the actual information about the machine running the server. So for security, we want to hide this example and information from it.

.. code-block::

    S> filename = $TemporaryDirectory <> "/example_file";

In a sandboxed environment or cloud environment, we might not have write access to a filesystem, not even a temporary one.

Guidelines for Writing Documentation
====================================


When a new builtin is added, it is expected to follow the following guidelines regarding the format of the docstrings and ``summary_text`` attribute, which are used for building the documentation. Some of these guidelines are reinforced by the CI.

``summary_text`` is used in the online documentation as a brief description of what the symbol represents. For builtins representing the head of expressions, ``summary_text``, starts with an active verb with the word in lowercase, e.g. "retrieve" as opposed to "Retrieve".  If you look at the section that the summary appears it is nice to use the same verb for similar kinds of things. For example we may "list" builtins that end with "List" (``EdgeList``, ``VertexList``) but, "find" builtins with "Index" at the end of the name ``EdgeIndex``, ``VertexIndex``. For variables, and options, do _not_ start with an active verb.

Docstrings contain information about the content of the documentation entry. They must consist on the following parts:

* Title and URL refs.
* Definition Block
* Extended description section.

These are described in the next sections.


Title
------

We can use ``pymathics.graph`` as an example to compare against.

When there is a Wikipedia entry, it goes first. See ``AdjacencyList`` for an example.

It may be that just a part of the Wikipedia entry is available. Fill in other text outside of the URL. See ``DirectedEdge`` for an example.

If there is no Wikipedia mention, it is okay to give some free titles. EdgeDelete is an example.

Or you can omit the title altogether. ``RandomGraph`` is an example.

In general, we go with the Wikipedia name rather than the WMA for the title, including symbolic parameter names. ``CompleteKaryTree`` is an example.

When the only thing available is a WMA link we add "link" to the title. ``EdgeList`` is an example.

Remember that line breaks are significant. ``\`` can be used to wrap a long line.
Start the url name on a new line after ``<url>``. For example:

```
<url>
:WMA link:
https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/EdgeList.html</url>
```

Note that there is no line break at the end before or after ``</url>``.

Please don't get too creative in formatting. There are many other areas in the selection of words to describe what is need may require care. But here it shouldn't require much thought for the _formatting_ aspects.

If the URL is too long, of course, you can split it up in a way that the URL tag understands.  Please inspect the URLs in a browser for change.  Ideally, you would click the link, but if not, or before, look at the URL that appears when the link is hovered over.



There should be at least one doc example for each function that is focused on describing what the function does (not how it can be tested).  Examples for tests should be added as pytests.


Definition Block
----------------

The title must be followed by a definition list ``<dl>``...``</dl>``, describing the different ways to use the symbol. For example, in the  Builtin class ``LaguerreL``::

     <dl>
       <dt>'LaguerreL'[$n$, $x$]
       <dd>returns the Laguerre polynomial of order $n$, $L_n(x)$.

       <dt>'LaguerreL'[$n$, $a$, $x$]
       <dd>returns the generalised Laguerre polynomial of order $n$ and index $a$, $L^a_n(x)$.
     </dl>

Note the two-space indentation after the ``<dl>`` tag. 

The ``<dt>`` fields show the form of using the symbol. The Mathics3 identifiers
must be enclosed in simple quotes (``'``), while parameters are written as inline LaTeX math-mode expressions.
The description field (``<dd>``) uses the same notation: parameter names enclosed by ``$`` and identifiers
by ``'``. Notice also that the description can include some inline LaTeX math-mode expressions.
If an identifier uses the special character `$`, it must be preceded by the escape character `\`. So, for instance,
to refer to the Symbol `$Failed` it must be written as `\\$Failed`. 


Extended Description Section
----------------------------

After the usage block, a brief explanation about the context in which the symbol is used is expected, including examples of use, details of the implementations, and possible issues. This section must contain at least one *Doctest* example for each entry in the usage block.
