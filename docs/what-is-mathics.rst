The Components of Mathics3
==========================

At one time, there was a single Python PyPI installable package that
made up this open-source version of the Wolfram language. It included
for example a Django-based front end.

However in order to facilitate using the parts of it in other projects
or the parts you need, the original package and GitHub repositories
have been broken up into separately installable packages, and separate
GitHub repositories. These repositories are now under the Mathics3
GitHub organization. (The old organization and GitHub repositories are
around, but you will find no development there.)

Splitting up into packages reduces the dependencies needed for many of
the individual components: when you only need part of Mathics3 you
don't need the code or dependencies for parts you don't want. For
example, if you might not need the Django-based front end; perhaps you
do everything from a command line interface. If that is the case, then
you don't need to install Django or MySQL which Django uses in our
implementation to save worksheet data.

On the other hand, if you are only interested in the Django interface
and will never use the command-line interface, then you don't need the
mathicsscript package and the Python terminal packages that pull in.

Natural-Language Processing (NLP) is a separate Mathics3 module; it
requires OS package support and word lists that you might not have
installed, and might not want to devote disk space for. Various Python
interpreters cannot build the Python NLTK package.

However, if you do want everything, we have a separate package called
`Mathics-omnibus <https://pypi.org/project/Mathics-omnibus/>`_ which
pulls in all of the Mathics-related packages. As part of the `GitHub
project <https://github.com/Mathics3/mathics-omnibus>`_ is a docker
setup.

Using this, you can use the full `Mathics3 suite via dockerhub
<https://hub.docker.com/r/mathicsorg/mathics>`_ without having to
build Mathics3 or have necessary OS libraries (including Python
itself) outside of the docker containers.

The pieces described next go into the individual Python packages that
make up the Mathics3 suite.


Mathics3 Core
-------------

The Mathics3 core contains a parser, an evaluator, and
some formatting routines.

Over time, formatting routines may be packaged separately.

There is also a very rudimentary command-line shell called ``mathics``.


The Mathics3 core is required for any work with Mathics3.

If you are developing a non-interactive application written in
Mathics3, you may no more than this.

Although we provide documentation `on-line
<https://mathics.org/docs/mathics-latest.pdf>`_, inside the `docker
image <https://hub.docker.com/r/mathicsorg/mathics>`_ , and
extractable from the that, should you want to build your PDF,
you'll need to have various TeX packages installed.

Front ends Mathics-Django and mathicsscript use Mathics core.

Mathics3 Character Tables and Tokenizer
---------------------------------------

This is the tokenizer or scanner portion for the Wolfram Language.

As such, it also contains a full set of translations between Wolfram
Language named characters, their Unicode/ASCII equivalents, and
code-points.

The scanner is used by Mathics3 Core, but it can also be used for
tokenizing and formatting Wolfram Language code. In fact,
mathics-pygments described in the next section use this.

You can install this portion from `PyPI
<https://pypi.org/project/Mathics-Scanner/>`_. The GitHub project is
`here <https://github.com/Mathics3/mathics-scanner>`_.

Mathics3 Syntax Highlighting
----------------------------

There is a syntax highlighter called mathics-pygments_ which uses `Pygments <https://pygments.org>`_. It is
based on rsmenon's `pygments-mathematics
<https://pypi.org/project/pygments-mathematica/>`_.

The main difference between the two is that the character tables are
used here. Possibly over time more parts of the scanner will be used
as well.

Mathicsscript uses this package.



mathicsscript
-------------

The Mathics3 core comes with a very rudimentary command-line
shell, if you want fancier shell features such as:

* Prompt toolkit and GNU Readline terminal interaction. This includes
   - saving command history between sessions.
   - variable completion, even for symbol names like `\\[Sigma]`
   - limited ESC keyboard input; for example *esc* ``p`` *esc* is π
* Syntax highlighting using mathics-pygments_
* Automatic detection of light or dark `terminal background color <https://pypi.org/project/term-background/>`_.
* Entering and displaying Unicode symbols such as used for Pi or Rule arrows

There is a separately-installable PyPI package called `mathicsscript <https://pypi.org/project/mathicsscript/>`_.

Django-based GUI
----------------

If you prefer, as many do, browser-based interaction with nicely
formatted graphics and MathML-formatted output, right now there is a
Django-based PyPI package `Mathics-Django
<https://pypi.org/project/Mathics-Django>`_.

Some of its features:

* Extensive online documentation and interactive documentation via Ajax
* Integrated graphics and MathML mathematics output via MathJax
* Notebook-like sessions

To use this, you will need Django 3.2.5 or later installed, and a
browser with JavaScript enabled.

Note: in the future, we intend to also provide a Jupyter-like interface.

Mathics3 Python Modules
-----------------------

Some features are optional and not automatically loaded when Mathics3
starts. Instead, these can be loaded from within Mathics3 using the
`Needs <https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Needs.html>`_
function.

Determining when Something should be a Mathics3 Module
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Here are some reasons you would put something inside a Mathics3 Module instead of inside the Mathics3 core:

* If what you are doing requires a dependency on an OS library. NLP
  functions are like this. Putting NLP functions in a Mathics3 Module,
  reduces the dependencies of Mathics3 core and therefore makes it easier
  to install Mathics3 core and allow it to be available across more
  environments than if it had a lot of OS dependencies required.
* If the feature is implemented using a package that can be thought of
  as one of alternative possibilities. For example, matplotlib
  rendering of graphs. There are other alternative methods of
  rendering graphs. However, Mathics3 Core has to provide *some* basic
  set of graph rendering; it currently uses SVG and basic Asymptote.
* Functions that are not listed in the Wolfram Language. For example
  Formats/Functions like ``ToPython[]`` and ``ToSymPy[]`` are not
  Wolfram Builtin Functions, but instead, a natural kind of
  extension. So that should be in a Mathics3 Module. The Mathics3
  debugger also doesn't follow Wolfram Language behavior, so that is
  also a Mathics3 Module.

If the thing you want to add is listed as a Wolfram Language Builtin Function, then it goes in Mathics core.

Below we list some of Mathics3 module packages. A full list can be
found by looking in the `Mathics3 organization
<https://github.com/Mathics3>`_.
